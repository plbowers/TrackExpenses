# TrackExpenses
Quick page that can be installed as a PWA to track expenses throughout the month

Tracking columns will include these:
* Report Type (P=Personal, I=International) (default=P unless otherwise by cookie)
* Date (default to today)
* Category (from a list)
* Description (free text)
* Amount (number)
* Currency (can be defaulted via cookie)
* Receipt (0..n photo[s])

Eventually a quick export will download the current items in a text file for import
